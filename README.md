# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Matching

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching or navigation problems. The `Routes` and `Route` components may not behave as anticipated, leading to incorrect page rendering or navigation failures.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code.  The solution, demonstrating correct usage and potential fixes, is found in `AppSolution.js`.
